## Ember Recipe Box
### My first Ember JS app. One of the FreeCodeCamp's projects.
**User:**

* can create recipes that have names, ingredients and image
* can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible
* can click into any of those recipes to view it
* can live-edit these recipes
* can delete these recipes

##### All recipes are saved in browser's local storage. If user refreshes the page, these recipes will still be there.
